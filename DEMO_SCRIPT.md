# Umanity — Demo Video Script (Under 3 Minutes)

> Record this as a screen recording with voiceover. Use the live deployed app at https://umanity-solana.vercel.app. Have Phantom wallet ready on Devnet with some SOL.

---

## [0:00 – 0:20] THE HOOK

**Show:** Landing page hero on desktop (the big "Crypto Charity, Resurrected" headline)

**Say:**
> "Crypto charity is dead. GoFundMe clones had no transparency. Charity tokens were just rug pulls. Donation pages? Donate once, forgotten forever. We're resurrecting it."

**Action:** Slowly scroll down the landing page past "The Graveyard" section showing the three dead trends, then into "The Resurrection" section.

---

## [0:20 – 0:40] THE SOLUTION

**Show:** Scroll to the Resurrection cards + tech stats band

**Say:**
> "This is Umanity — a social impact network on Solana. It's not just a donation page. It's a full social app where giving IS the content. On-chain escrow means funds are locked until the community votes to release them. Everything is transparent, verifiable, and social."

**Action:** Click "Connect Wallet" — show Phantom connecting on Devnet. You land on the full app dashboard.

---

## [0:40 – 1:15] LIVE DEMO — DONATE

**Show:** Click the Donate tab

**Say:**
> "Six active charity pools — from Palestine Red Crescent to local animal rescue. Let me donate right now."

**Action:** Click "One-Tap Donate" (0.01 SOL) on any pool. Sign the Phantom transaction.

**Say:**
> "That just hit the Solana blockchain. Real SOL went to an on-chain escrow vault — not to anyone's personal wallet. Let me prove it."

**Action:** After donation confirms, the feed auto-posts. Switch to Feed tab.

**Say:**
> "My donation automatically posted to the social feed. Everyone in my network sees it. This is social proof — the same psychology that makes you double-tap on Instagram, except here it drives real-world impact."

---

## [1:15 – 1:45] SOCIAL LAYER

**Show:** Feed tab — scroll through posts, like a post, open comments

**Say:**
> "This feed is powered by Tapestry Protocol. Twenty-nine social API integrations — profiles, follows, likes, comments, search, referrals, even Impact Dares where you challenge friends to donate."

**Action:** Click Explore tab, show suggested follows and search. Follow someone.

**Say:**
> "Full social graph. Follow donors you trust. See who's giving to what. Social accountability makes people give more — and keep giving."

**Action:** Show the leaderboard in the right sidebar (desktop) — Top donors, Points, Social tabs.

---

## [1:45 – 2:15] GOVERNANCE

**Show:** Click Govern tab

**Say:**
> "Here's where it gets interesting. Crypto governance died because votes never controlled real money. On Umanity, they do."

**Action:** Show a governance proposal. Click into it, show the vote breakdown.

**Say:**
> "Every donation earns voting power. One SOL equals one thousand points. When a charity pool hits a milestone threshold, a governance proposal is auto-created. The community votes on whether to release the escrowed funds. Your vote controls real money locked in a Solana vault."

**Action:** Cast a vote if possible, or show an already-voted proposal.

---

## [2:15 – 2:40] TECH + PROFILE

**Show:** Click Profile tab — show Impact Score, donation streak, NFT certificates, social graph

**Say:**
> "Every user gets an impact profile. Donation streaks, tiered certificates — Bronze through Diamond — followers, and a portable on-chain identity. All verifiable."

**Action:** Briefly scroll the profile, then cut to a wide shot of the desktop 3-column layout.

**Say:**
> "Under the hood: two Anchor programs with eight hundred fifty-six lines of Rust, thirteen on-chain instructions, forty-two API routes, six Solana Blinks so you can donate from any X feed, and the entire social layer built on Tapestry."

---

## [2:40 – 3:00] THE CLOSE

**Show:** Back to the landing page or the feed with posts visible

**Say:**
> "GoFundMe clones died because there was no transparency. Charity tokens died because there was no accountability. Donation pages died because there was no community. Umanity brings all three back — on Solana, with social proof, and with community governance over real escrowed funds."

**Pause one beat.**

> "Umanity. Crypto charity, resurrected."

## Recording Tips

- **Desktop first** — the 3-column layout looks most impressive
- **Use the seeded demo data** so the feed has posts, leaderboard has entries
- **Don't rush** — let each screen breathe for 1-2 seconds before talking
- **Edit out loading spinners** — cut to the loaded state
- **Show the Phantom transaction popup** — it proves this is real on-chain
- **Keep energy calm but confident** — Apple keynote vibe, not hype
- **Use screen recording at 1080p or higher**
- **If recording voiceover separately**: record screen first, then voiceover on top
