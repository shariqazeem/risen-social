# Umanity — Demo Video Script

---

## 1. LANDING PAGE [0:00 - 0:30]

> On landing page. Look at camera.

"Assalam o Alaikum everyone, my name is Shariq and I built Umanity for the Solana Graveyard Hackathon. Now the whole idea behind this hackathon is to resurrect dead crypto trends, right? And when I looked at what died in crypto — Social-Fi, charity tokens, DAOs, NFTs, loyalty programs, Blinks — I realized all of these failed for the same reason. They had no real purpose. So I brought all six of them back to life inside one app — a social impact network where people actually donate, govern funds together, and prove their impact on-chain."

> Scroll down slowly to show the 6 resurrection cards and the tech stats section

"You can see right here — each dead trend and exactly how we resurrected it. And this isn't a prototype — we're talking two Anchor programs, eight hundred fifty-six lines of Rust, twenty-nine Tapestry integrations, forty-two API routes, and six live Solana Blinks. So let me walk you through the whole thing."

> Scroll back up. Click Connect Wallet.

## 2. ONBOARDING [0:30 - 0:55]

> Phantom popup appears. Approve. Onboarding loads.

"So the moment you connect your wallet, you land on this clean onboarding flow. First thing it asks you is to create your identity — your username and display name."

> Type username and display name. Click Continue.

"Then it suggests real people for you to follow. These aren't fake accounts — these are actual Tapestry Protocol profiles living on the social graph. You pick who you want to follow and their donations will show up in your feed."

> Select a few. Click Continue.

"Last step, you write a quick bio, and that's it — your on-chain social identity is created on Tapestry and you're inside the app."

> Finish onboarding. Dashboard loads.

## 3. THE FEED [0:55 - 1:20]

> 3-column desktop layout is visible. Feed tab active.

"And this is the main dashboard. If you notice, it looks and feels like X — three column layout, feed in the center, navigation on the left, and leaderboard with recent activity on the right. But the difference is, every single post you see here is connected to a real donation on the Solana blockchain."

> Scroll the feed. Point at posts.

"People are donating to causes, and those donations automatically post to the feed. You can like them, you can comment on them, you can follow the donors. This is how we resurrected Social-Fi — we made giving the content instead of farming and airdrops."

> Like a post.

## 4. DONATE [1:20 - 1:55]

> Click Donate tab.

"Now let me show you the core of the app — the donation system. We have six active charity pools right now, and the important thing to understand is that none of this money goes to anyone's personal wallet."

> Show the escrow info banner.

"Every single SOL that gets donated goes into an Anchor escrow vault on-chain. The funds sit there, locked, until the community votes to release them through governance. That's how we killed the rug pull problem — you literally cannot run away with the money."

> Click Donate on a pool. Phantom popup. Sign it.

"Let me make a real donation right now so you can see it happen live. I'm signing this with my Phantom wallet on Devnet and this is going straight to the blockchain."

> Transaction confirms.

"Done. And watch this — if I go back to my feed..."

> Click Feed tab. Show the auto-posted donation.

"My donation just automatically posted to the social feed for everyone to see. That's social proof driving real-world charity."

---

## 5. GOVERNANCE [1:55 - 2:25]

> Click Govern tab.

"Now here's the part I'm most proud of. DAOs completely died in crypto because voting never actually did anything — it was all governance theater. On Umanity, your vote controls real money sitting in a Solana vault."

> Show voting power and proposals.

"Every SOL you donate earns you a thousand voting points, and you can see my voting power right here. When a charity pool hits a fundraising milestone, a fund-release proposal is automatically created, and the community has to vote on whether those escrowed funds should be released to the charity."

> Click on a proposal to show details.

"So this isn't some symbolic governance — if the community says no, the money stays locked in the vault. Your vote has real financial consequences and that is what makes this different from every other DAO that came before it."

---

## 6. PROFILE & CLOSE [2:25 - 2:55]

> Click Profile tab.

"And finally, every user gets a full impact profile. You can see your impact score, your donation streak, how many causes you've supported, your followers and who you're following, and your referral link to invite others."

> Scroll to show impact certificates.

"And these right here are your impact certificates — this is how we resurrected NFTs. Instead of random JPEGs, these are soulbound certificates tied to actual donations. Bronze, Silver, Gold, Diamond — each tier represents real generosity, not speculation."

> Look at camera for the close.

"So that's Umanity. Six dead crypto trends — Social-Fi, charity tokens, DAOs, NFTs, loyalty programs, and Blinks — all resurrected into one social impact network built entirely on Solana with Tapestry Protocol, Anchor programs, and real on-chain escrow. We didn't just build a donation page — we built the app that crypto charity was always supposed to be."

> Pause. Confident.

"Umanity. Crypto charity, resurrected. JazakAllah Khair."

## Tips

- **Pre-load every tab** before recording so nothing needs to load on camera
- **Phantom unlocked** with devnet SOL ready
- **Speak naturally** — this script is a guide, use your own energy and words
- **Don't restart for small mistakes** — just keep going, trim in editing
- **Target: 2:50** — leaves breathing room under 3:00
